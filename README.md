# Binary Search Tree Sort Application

The application takes a user input of either real numbers or fraction values and using tree sort algorithm will organize the values
either in a descending or ascending order depending on the user input. The application uses a simple Java GUI to allow input and
sort settings.

## Getting Started

The project is built using Java so using any IDE that supports Java will work and can be used to create a .jar file to run in the desktop. 
For the application to work you will need to use correctly formatted real numbers or fractions that will be entered in the input field. Once
you have chosen your values you will choose the radio buttons matching your input.
